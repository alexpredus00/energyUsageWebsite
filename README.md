Home energy usage website implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end and NodeJS and MongoDB for the back-end.

The objective of this website is to help a user better understand their house, get familiar with how much energy each appliance consumes and in the end, give some tips on possible improvements.  

The information is saved to the database using a button at the end of every page.
The website is structured on multiple pages, each representing a room found in a regular house, filled with the usual appliances. The user has to input the energy usage information, easily found on the energy label, along with the runtime and the quantity. 

At the end, he will receive information about the total energy consumptions, different charts comparing to other households and other such things, tips on where he can improve efficiency etc

* Result page will not work without the backend running (backend/app.js) because the information cannot be saved to the database *
